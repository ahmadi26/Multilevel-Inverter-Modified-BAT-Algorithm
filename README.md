Abstract: Due to the growing applications of multilevel inverters in electrical systems, in this paper we use an optimized meta-heuristic algorithm called Modified-BAT (M-BAT) algorithm to find switching angles in multilevel inverters by modulating the pulse width of the selected harmonic voltage source. In order to satisfy the first-order harmonics and reduce the undesirable harmonics in the output voltage of multi-level cascade inverters, H bridge has been used. In this research, M-BAT optimization algorithm has been used to calculate the optimal switching angles in multi-level cascade inverters of Bridge-H. Switching angles in multi-level cascade bridge-H inverters must be calculated to generate the required main frequency voltage range while not creating undesirable harmonics and the total harmonic distortion value of the output voltage is low. The simulation results show the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm in determining the appropriate switching angles to reduce undesirable harmonics and produce waveforms with very low and close to sinusoidal harmonic distortion. In addition, the DC voltage sources of multi-level inverter inputs have uncertainty, and in this case, a random strategy has been used to determine the angles, which uses the integration of an optimized algorithm called M-BAT with the Monte Carlo simulation method.
